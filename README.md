<b>Assignment Prompt</b>: 

You recently ran a survey experiment. In the experiment, subjects were asked to read a business case about the use of AI in management. Then they were asked if they would recommend adopting AI in management (yes/no). The study contained experimental variation. Half of the subjects were asked to read an article about ethical issues in AI before beginning the study. 

Your assignment is to create a publication-quality table of the effect of the reading assignment on AI adoption recommendations.
